=== pin command

The `pin` command queries a Docker daemon (local or remote)
or a docker registry (e.g. docker hub)
for images matching the used image references and pins
the image reference by appending the digest.

*Note* the Docker daemon is used by default, but only knows pulled images!

==== Pin well-known image references

include::../end-to-end/test.sh[tag=pinNginxWithDockerd]
----

Given the following multi-stage dockerfile:

[source,Dockerfile]
----
include::../end-to-end/pin-examples/Dockerfile-nginx.org[]
----


File after execution:
[source,Dockerfile]
----
include::../end-to-end/pin-examples/Dockerfile-nginx-any.expected[]
----

stdout is empty +
stderr is empty +
exit code:
include::../end-to-end/results/pinNginxWithDockerd.exitCode[]


==== Pin all image references in a dockerfile using a docker registry
